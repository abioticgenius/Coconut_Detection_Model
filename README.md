# Coconut_Detection_Model
The Coconut Detection Model that I have made here is a machine learning model based on YOLOv8n that predicts the number of coconuts in a specific image.
## How to run the model
1. Open the coconut_counter.ipynb file attached.
2. Download the custom dataset that I have made and hosted on Roboflow from [here](https://app.roboflow.com/abioticgenius/coco_detect-ofl88/).
